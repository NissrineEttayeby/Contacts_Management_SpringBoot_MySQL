# Contacts Management Application(Spring Boot)

This project is a Contact Management Application developed using Spring Boot, Java EE, and MySQL. The application provides a comprehensive solution for managing contacts efficiently. Each contact is defined by various attributes, including ID, name, first name, phone numbers (personal and professional), address, email addresses (personal and professional), and gender (male or female).

# Features
* **Create a New Contact**: Users can easily create a new contact by providing all the necessary details.
* **Display Contacts in Alphabetical Order**: The application displays the list of contacts in alphabetical order, making it convenient to find and browse through contacts.
* **Delete a Contact**: Users have the option to delete a contact when it is no longer needed.
* **Modify a Contact**: Contacts can be edited and updated with new information as needed.
* **Search by Name**: Users can search for a specific contact by their name, facilitating quick access to desired contacts.
* **Search by Phone Number**: The application allows users to search for a contact by entering a personal or professional phone number, and the application will display the associated information.
* **Create Contact Groups**: Users can create groups (e.g., family, friends) and add zero or more contacts to each group.
* **Delete a Group**: Group deletion does not remove the contacts within it. The application also enables users to search for groups by name.
* **Fuzzy Name Search**: The search functionality for names is improved to allow retrieval of contacts even in cases of minor typographical errors using String Edit Distance Algorithm.
